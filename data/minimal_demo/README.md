# Minimal Demo Dataset

This folder contains **minimal example data files** for demonstrating how to use the `blupf90_custom_stats.R` script. These files are **dummy data** intended for educational purposes and have been created to mimic the structure of the actual input files used in the script.

## Contents:

1. **renadd04_demo.ped** - A minimal example pedigree file.
2. **renf90_demo.dat** - A minimal example data file containing trait values for animals.

### How to Use:

These files are designed to work with the R script `blupf90_custom_stats.R` available in the main repository. You can use these example files to run the script and see how it processes the data and generates statistics.

### Notes:

- The **renadd04_demo.ped** file contains animal IDs and pedigree information for a small set of animals.
- The **renf90_demo.dat** file contains trait values (with "0" representing missing data) for those animals.
- Replace these example files with your own data when running the script in your real use case.
